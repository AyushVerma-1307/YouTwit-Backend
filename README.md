# Social Media Platform Backend

## Overview
This project is a backend application for a social media platform that combines features of YouTube and Twitter. It provides functionalities for users to upload, view, and interact with videos, as well as post and engage with tweets.

## Key Features
- **User Authentication and Authorization:** Allows users to register, login, and manage their accounts securely. Authentication middleware ensures access control to specific routes based on user roles.
- **Video Management:** Enables users to upload videos with titles, descriptions, and thumbnails. Tracks views and likes for each video.
- **Commenting and Interaction:** Users can post comments on videos and tweets, as well as like them. Supports comment threads and replies for deeper interactions.
- **Tweeting and Timeline:** Allows users to post tweets with text content, which can be viewed, liked, and retweeted by others. A timeline feature displays tweets from followed users.
- **Playlist Creation and Management:** Users can create playlists to organize their favorite videos, with the ability to add or remove videos from playlists.
- **Cloudinary Integration:** Media files such as videos, thumbnails, avatars, and other assets are stored on Cloudinary. Integration includes upload and delete functions for managing media files.
- **Error Handling and Logging:** Implements error handling middleware to catch and handle errors throughout the application. Logging tracks application events and errors for debugging and monitoring purposes.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend Framework:** Node.js with Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB with Mongoose
- **Cloud Storage:** Cloudinary
- **Authentication:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- **Middleware:** Multer for file uploads, asyncHandler for error handling
- **Deployment:** Docker for containerization, potentially deployed on AWS, Heroku, or Azure cloud platforms.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with frontend frameworks like React or Angular to create a complete application experience.
- Implementation of real-time features using WebSockets for live updates and notifications.
